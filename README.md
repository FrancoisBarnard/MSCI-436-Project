# MSCI 436 Project
Please note that the contents of this repository are intended to be used and viewed only by relevant parties inlcuding MSCI 436 teaching staff and team members. Additionally, the model is not of my own design and is built based off of Niharika Pandit's notebook at https://www.kaggle.com/code/niharika41298/netflix-visualizations-recommendation-eda.

Run the model with the following command: python -m streamlit run model.py
